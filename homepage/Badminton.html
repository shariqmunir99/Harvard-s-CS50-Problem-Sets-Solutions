            <h1> Sania The Iron Woman</h1>
            <br>
            <p> Sania Mirza  born 15 November 1986) is an Indian professional tennis player. A former doubles world No. 1, she has won six major titles three in women's doubles and three in mixed doubles. From 2003 until her retirement from singles in 2013, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as the Indian No. 1 in singles. Throughout her career, Mirza has established herself as one of the most known,[8] highest-paid, and influential athletes in India.

                In singles, Mirza had wins over Svetlana Kuznetsova, Vera Zvonareva, and Marion Bartoli, as well as former world-number-ones Martina Hingis, Dinara Safina, and Victoria Azarenka. She is the highest-ranked Indian female player ever, peaking at world No. 27 in mid-2007. However, a major wrist injury caused her to shift to doubles. Mirza has achieved a number of firsts for women's tennis in India, including reaching the one million-US$ mark in career earnings (currently over US$7.2 million), winning a singles WTA Tour title, and winning a major title, as well as qualifying for (and eventually winning) the WTA Finals in 2014 in doubles partnering Cara Black, and defending her title the following year partnering Martina Hingis.[11] Mirza plans to retire from professional tennis in the 2023 season.[12]</p>
