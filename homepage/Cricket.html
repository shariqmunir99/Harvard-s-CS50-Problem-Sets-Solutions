            <h2> GOAT of Cricket?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Virat The King Kohli was considered the goat of a long long time but in the recent his form declined and he became unable to score well in almost all of his matches.<br> On the other hand Babar was slowly but cinsistenlty proving his worth by scoring in almost every match. This resulted in him setting the BAR so high that even an outstanding innings of 70 is considered "Not Satisfactory" by his audience. This Fact alone truly makes him the goat. </p>
