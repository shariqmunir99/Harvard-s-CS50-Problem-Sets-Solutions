Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With a small number of simulations such as 10 the prediction seemed incorrect.



Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: We can call the predictions good enough after 1000 simulations.
